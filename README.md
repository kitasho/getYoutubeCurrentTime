When you watch on Youtube, press Ctrl+x to save a timestamp of the current playback time to the clipboard.
Pressing Ctrl+s saves a timestamp of 5 seconds before the current playback time to the clipboard.
However, when enabled, the normal Ctrl+x/s function is disabled while watching Youtube.
Please change the key bindings if necessary.
